Hi, I'm Clemens. 

I'm studying mechatronics and robotics and I'm passionate about AI and deep learning. 
I love to implement projects with topics like robotics, deep learning and computer vision. 
I have knowledge about:
- CAD with Inventor and Fusion and 3D printing,
- Deep learning with Python Tensorflow, Keras and Pytorch
- Computer vision with OpenCV. Some of my projects you can find below. 

I'm always keen to learn and implement new things.

Feel free to explore my projects - feedback and collaboration are welcome.
